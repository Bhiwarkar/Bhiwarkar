Hello! I’m Poonam Bhiwarkar, a dedicated UX/UI designer with a passion for creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. My journey in design is driven by a deep curiosity about how people interact with technology and a relentless pursuit of solutions that make those interactions seamless and enjoyable.

In this portfolio, you’ll discover a collection of projects that showcase my commitment to blending creativity with functionality. Each piece reflects my belief that great design is not just about aesthetics but about understanding users' needs and crafting experiences that resonate on a personal level.

From user research and wireframing to interactive prototyping and visual design, I approach each project with a user-centered mindset and a keen eye for detail. I thrive on collaboration and am constantly inspired by the challenges and opportunities that come with designing for diverse audiences and evolving technologies.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring the work that I’m proud to share. Let’s connect and see how we can create something exceptional together!
